    title: 'Representing and Quantifying Conformational Changes of Kinases and Phosphatases Using the TSR-Based Algorithm',
    authors: 'Tarikul I. Milon, Krishna Rauniyar, Sara Furman, ,Khairum H. Orthi, Yingchun Wang, Vijay Raghavan, Wu Xu',
    conference: 'Kinases and Phosphatases',
    year: 2025,
    abstract: 'The main objective of this study is to provide structural insight into conformational changes. We also aim to link TSR-based structural descriptors to their functions. The 3D structures of 2527 kinases and 505 phosphatases are studied. This study results in several major findings as follows: (i) The clustering method yields functionally coherent clusters of kinase and phosphatase families and their superfamilies. (ii) Specific TSR keys are identified as structural signatures for different types of kinases and phosphatases. (iii) TSR keys can identify different conformations of the well-known DFG motif of kinases. (iv) A significant number of phosphatases have their own distinct DFG motifs.',

    title: 'Development of a novel representation of drug 3D structures and enhancement of the TSR-based method for probing drug and target interactions',
    authors: 'Tarikul I. Milon, Yuhong Wang, Ryan L. Fontenot, Poorya Khajouie, Francois Villinger, Vijay Raghavan, Wu Xu',
    conference: 'Computational Biology and Chemistry',
    year: 2024,
    abstract: 'A new approach to representing ligand and drug 3D structures is introduced and evaluated. A novel algorithm calculating cross TSR keys is developed for enabling comparisons of drug/ligand - target complexes. The results demonstrate the capability of the TSR-based method to interpret hierarchical relationships of drugs and drug - target complexes.',

    title: 'Introducing mirror-image discrimination capability to the TSR-based method for capturing stereo geometry and understanding hierarchical structure relationships of protein receptor family',
    authors: 'Titli Sarkar, Yuwu Chen, Yu Wang, Yixin Chen, Feng Chen, Camille R. Reaux, Laura E. Moore, Vijay Raghavan, Wu Xu',
    conference: 'Computational Biology and Chemistry',
    year: 2023,
    abstract: 'Mirror-image discrimination capability is introduced into the Triangular Spatial Relationship (TSR)-based key generation formula to capture stereo geometry. Applying mirror images decreases structural similarity which can be partially explained by the observation of a decrease in common keys. For a hierarchically organized structure dataset, applying mirror images enhances the opportunity to discover specific keys that exclusively belong to certain types of proteins.',

    conference: 'Data in Brief',
    year: 2021,
    abstract: 'We propose amino-acid scoring matrices that capture “evolutionary closeness” information based on BLOSUM62 matrix, and present the development of a new visualization method where keys are organized according to evolutionary closeness and shown in a 2D image.',

    conference: 'Computational Biology and Chemistry',
    year: 2021,
    abstract: 'Exploring the effectiveness of the TSR-based method for protein clustering and structural motif identification via amino acid grouping. We have classified the keys into the different categories for better understanding of protein structure relations. Applying amino acid grouping to the TSR-based method modestly improves the accuracy of protein clustering in certain cases.',

    title: 'Development of a TSR-Based Method for Protein 3-D Structural Comparison With Its Applications to Protein Classification and Motif Discovery',
    authors: 'Sarika Kondra, Titli Sarkar, Vijay Raghavan, Wu Xu',
    conference: 'Frontiers in Chemistry',
    year: 2021,
    abstract: 'We have developed a novel method where the 3-D structure of a protein is modeled using the concept of Triangular Spatial Relationship (TSR), where triangles are constructed with the Cα atoms of a protein as vertices. Every triangle is represented using an integer, which we denote as “key,” A key is computed using the length, angle, and vertex labels based on a rule-based formula, which ensures assignment of the same key to identical TSRs across proteins.',
