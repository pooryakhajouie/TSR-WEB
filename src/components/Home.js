          <h2>Overview of the TSR Method</h2>
          <p>
            The TSR-Based Method is an innovative approach to protein structure analysis. By modeling the 3D structure of proteins using triangular spatial relationships (TSRs) among CÎ± atoms, we assign a unique integer "key" to each triangle. These keys are computed based on the lengths, angles, and vertex labels of the triangles, ensuring that identical TSRs across different proteins receive the same key. This method allows for accurate quantification of structural similarities between proteins by comparing the number of matching keys.
